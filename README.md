# PWM(Pulse width modulation) Generator
This Project is about design and simulation of PWM generator with variable duty cycle.
# Introduction
Pulse-width modulation (PWM), or pulse-duration modulation (PDM), is a method of reducing the average power delivered by an electrical signal, by effectively chopping it up into discrete parts. The average value of voltage (and current) fed to the load is controlled by turning the switch between supply and load on and off at a fast rate. The longer the switch is on compared to the off periods, the higher the total power supplied to the load. The rate (or frequency) at which the power supply must switch can vary greatly depending on load and application.
<h3>Duty Cycle </h3>
  A duty cycle or power cycle is the fraction of one period in which a signal or system is active.Duty cycle is commonly expressed as a percentage or a ratio.
